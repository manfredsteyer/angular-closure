# Shrinking Angular-Bundles with Closure

This is an extended version of the [Angular's team proof of concept](https://github.com/angular/closure-demo) that shows how to use Angular together with Closure (State: End of May 2017).

It shows the following aspects:

- Using other Angular packages through the example of Angular Material
- Using NodeJS/CommonJS packages through the example of sha256 and base64-js
- Using own Angular packages
